# Shopfumi727vn Website

Welcome to the Shopfumi727vn website repository! This is my first website that I created by myself, and it's primarily for educational purposes. As a result, it might look a bit unconventional, but it's a part of my learning journey.

## Description

This website was built as a hands-on project to practice HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It includes a homepage, about page, services page, and a contact page. The content is minimal, and the design might appear simple, but it serves as a foundation for my learning progress.
